INSTALLATION
------------

For iOS8+ use drag and drop MOCAKit.framework into your app project in XCode.
Ensure it is added in 'Embedded Binaries' section of General target tab as well as
it is listed in "Linked Frameworks and Binaries" section.

The framework is a universal FAT binary compiled for the following architectures:
- armv7/armv7s/arm64/x86_64/i386

To support iOS 6 and 7 apps, use static library libMOCALib.a provided in the bundle.
The library is a universal FAT library compiled for the following architectures:
- armv7/armv7s/arm64/x86_64/i386

Ensure the following frameworks and libraries are added as binary dependencies:
- MobileCoreServices.framework
- SystemConfiguration.framework
- CoreBluetooth.framework
- CoreLocation.framework
- UIKit.framework
- AudioToolbox.framework
- libsqlite3.0.dynlib
- PassKit.framework (optional)

For iOS 8, ensure the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription property is added to your plist.
For example:

NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription=This app will use your location information to identify nearby places and to notify you about available proximity experiences.

In app capabilities, ensure the following entitlements are enabled:
- Location updates
- Background fetch
- Remote notifications
- Uses Bluetooth LE accessories (optional)

Optinally, enable Passbook entitlement and link PassKit.framework to use Passbook experiences in your app.
